1	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	752 753	"Some accidents are attributed to carelessness, but many accidents and all sicknesses are attributed to supernatural causes or spirits."
2	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	750 774	"If a child is frightened, the mother or guardian quickly takes a handful of leaves and sweeps the place where the little creature was frightened. They do this so that the child's soul will not run off in fear and the child become sick."
3	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	750 774	"480 Sometimes when a child is sick, they believe that the soul of the little creature has abandoned its body. Then they dispatch commissions in pursuit of it, which pass through the sites where they suspect that the child has been, and they come back sweeping the path with some branches and calling aloud for the little creature. If the child improves, it is because its soul was found; otherwise they must have missed the site where it was."
4	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 755 776	"They believe that some sicknesses are due to the spirit or spirits which have got into the body of the sick person. In order for the sick person to recover his health, the harmful spirit must be cast out of his body. The one who tries to remove this spirit from the body of a sick person first takes a little “ yopo ” by way of the nasal passage. He then intones a crooning song, while he marches to and fro in front of the patient. Then, from time to time he approaches the latter and rubs the affected part, which he pinches and hits, pulling on it, threatening the spirit and asking it to go away, making all sorts of noises in order to frighten the spirit (or spirits) so that they will go away. After being with his patient for a few minutes, he resumes the crooning. This practice is repeated many times, and if the desired outcome is not obtained, other men will test their forces, trying to cast out from there the harmful spirit."
5	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	755 776	"They might then come to the conclusion that this is not a matter of a sickness caused by a spirit hidden in the body of the sick person, but rather by one which has hidden in some part of the settlement. Thus a group of men organizes a “hunt for the spirit.” Each of them takes a little “ yopo ” by way of the nasal passage, and, after crooning for a short time in front of the sick person, they begin to make an inspection throughout the settlement, house by house, inspecting every basket and corner, swinging machetes and axes, pointing with the arrows, blowing through the “ yopo ” tubes as if they were blowguns, continuing the whole [Page 52] 480 cont. time their croonings and threats directed at the harmful spirit. From time to time they pick up some object which they take with them. Sometimes they finish by inspecting the whole circle of houses, but more frequently the one who heads the “hunt for the spirit” points with his finger at some object, which one of them picks up, the whole group suddenly rushing toward the hut where the sick person is."
6	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	755 787	"481 Frequently one of those who participate in the “hunt for the spirit” falls into a paroxysm, which he generally ends with a tremendous leap into the air, to fall unconscious on the ground. The women immediately bring water and after a while manage to revive him."
7	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	755 787	"On one occasion a man who was crooning before a sick child suddenly lost his mind and began to say strange things. It seemed as though a strange power had seized him, to the point where it was necessary for six men to hold him so that the women could throw water on him to bring him out of his spell."
8	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	754	They also believe that a man can “send” a sickness or misfortune to another. Frequently the majority of the croonings which they intone in the evenings when they have taken “ yopo ” are designed to “send” calamities to their enemies.
9	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	123 752 754	"On a certain occasion, when all were camped about two hours of travel from the settlement, a girl was bitten by a poisonous snake. Her father came to get me to treat her. He told me that he was very angry, and he asked me if it were I who had sent the snake. He was very pleased when I assured him that I had not sent it."
10	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	754	"They believe that a person can cause an enemy great harm, sickness, and even death, by gathering up “the track” of the enemy and rubbing it between the palms of the hands. For this reason the Guaika /Waica/ do not like to walk in front of somebody who is not in all certainty his friend, especially over soft earth."
11	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	754	"The Guaika prepare certain powders which, when they are thrown in the air or blown in the direction of an enemy, can cause him annoyances or harm, according to what they believe, although the said enemy might be many miles away in another settlement."
12	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 784	"There is a taboo with respect to the burning of cloth or paper. The burning of cloth or paper, according to what they believe, causes sickness and /482/ perhaps death. The Guaika do not dare to do it “against an enemy,” since they are afraid that they might die also."
13	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 775	"Men cannot see a “ bole ” -- the spirit or soul of a dead person which has returned -- but women can see them on occasion, and, when they do, it is almost certain that the “ bole ” will make them sick. The “ bole ” has two eyes like embers, a cold skin, and in general has human forms. It customarily passes by way of the paths, especially at night, and frequently returns to abandoned settlements. They can talk and shout like a man; and many strange noises which are heard in the woods are attributed to the nearness of a “ bole .” The fall of a tree by itself is also attributed to a “ bole. ”"
14	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 775 781	"Once a woman told us about her encounter with a “ bole .” She had been awakened by something which touched her and hit her in the ribs. When she woke up, a voice said to her: “There are enemies outside.” She became very frightened and did not go back to sleep for the rest of the night."
15	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 775	The mere presence of a “ bole ” is considered sufficient to cause an acute pain in some part of the body.
16	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 775	Frequently we were asked by the Indians if there were “ boles ” the night before in the surroundings.
17	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 775	"It is believed that the “ boles ” travel alone in open country. Thus, they assume that a few palm leaves obstructing the entrance to the path are usually sufficient to block their way. It is also believed that fire is an effective weapon against the “ boles, ” whereas an arrow would be useless."
18	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	751	There is a belief that a certain seed is efficacious for keeping danger away from the children. They string these seeds as if they were beads and hang them around the child's neck.
19	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753	"Any strange or rare object can be considered to have given rise to an epidemic. According to their knowledge and understanding, it might be some kind of foreign sorcery."
20	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	177 755	"The Guaika appreciate our medicine for the treatment of sores and sicknesses, but for them this medicine is simply another enchanted or magical substance."
21	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	752	483 The treatment which they use for a bee sting is to tie the member thus hurt with a piece of vine or string above the sting. They also suck the poison out of the wound.
22	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	752	"The treatment for the bite of a spider or snake is similar, tying and sucking. Later, the croonings are considered appropriate for driving away evil forces."
23	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	752	"If a man is wounded by a poisoned dart, the wound is sucked and he will live. If he is wounded where the poison cannot be sucked out, he will quickly die. When an animal or a man is mortally wounded by a poisoned arrow, he falls, loses control of his muscles, and then dies, shuddering, perhaps when the poison reaches the heart or lungs."
24	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	727 751	"One who has killed an enemy on a raid must sit down on the ground and, taking a little piece of vine (perhaps some two centimeters in length), has to scrape one side of his own head in different places. If he fails to do this, some evil may overtake him."
25	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	755 758	"Sick persons receive all possible care, in addition to all the incantations and exorcisms which are cast against the opposing forces of the spirits."
26	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	758	"A sick person is well fed. If it is not possible for him to take certain foods, the Guaika will make every possible effort to get for him what he can eat."
27	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	758	"An old woman who had an infection in her mouth and a throat so large that it was almost impossible for her to swallow anything was given honey as food. They tipped her head back and poured the honey into her mouth. They had a fire lighted for her all the time, and someone was with her constantly. When the settlement moved, she was carried on a man's back by means of a strap or cord such as is customarily used for loads or small children."
28	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	515 758	"They bathe sick persons. If the patient cannot go to the stream, they bathe him part by part at home and even in his own hammock."
29	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 774 775	"The soul can abandon the body and return later. A seriously sick person in general loses consciousness while his soul is absent. This is why they frequently go looking for the soul of a sick child, to return tit to his body. The soul of an adult, on the other hand, should know how to find its way back."
30	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	753 776	“Suliliwa” can hide himself in the settlements and cause sicknesses. “Wakaliwa” can get into the human body and cause sickness.
31	"Barker, James.  Memoir on the culture of the Waica"	754 756 789	Sorcery and magic are practiced by most of the men. They believe that by taking a little “ yopo ” through the nasal passage they may have a greater influence on the spirits. There are religious advisers who apparently know the spirits and recommend the measures which must be taken against them.
32	"Barker, James. Raids among the Waica"	123 721 752 755	"We dressed rapidly and went to the aldea . Most of the men had gone off in pursuit of the raiders. The women were pouring water on the wound, while the sorcerer sang over it. Soon all of the reserve water of the aldea was used up. They asked us if we could help them. We called Ed Killiam, who brought his snakebite kit and sucked out the wound with it, until we did not dare do any more for fear of his losing too much blood, since he was bleeding freely. We also prayed."
33	"Barker, James. Raids among the Waica"	123 609 750	"A little before this an old woman from Shibaatía-tjeti visited some of her Majecototjeti relatives and told them how in her aldea they did not like foreigners, because they were always curing people. When someone in the aldea was wounded, [Page 14] 163 cont. they wanted that person to die. I assured them that we alone had not cured the boy. The whole aldea had asked God to cure him, and God had answered. The people of the aldea affirmed that this was the case. They had prayed sufficiently, and God had spared his life."
34	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	221 241 342 361 756	"One exception is Camp Xiwarí, which is 35 kilometers north of the Cachoeira dos Indios on the upper Aracá. Three-fourths of the circle, which is 28 meters in diameter, is made up of ten of the small huts described, while a similarly constructed dwelling seven meters long and five meters high occupies the remaining fourth. In the center of the circle, as usual, stands the chief's hut. Around the camp, rocas (forest clearings) have been laid out, where bananas, pupunha palms, manioc, species of sweet potatoes, and tobacco are planted. The Surára stay here every year between the months of October and December. In the large huts at that time two young men about 20 years old are always trained as medicine man's helpers for two months by the chief and his brother (see pp. 143 f.)."
35	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	411 422 431 437 584 755 764 796	"It should be mentioned further that bows and arrows represent the most valuable private property of every man, and they also play a large part in all magical and religious practices (cures of the sick, festivals, dances, etc.). Furthermore, the weapons are favorite trade items and gifts of honor which the Surára and Pakidái occasionally receive from the Xiriána or give the latter during visits (see pp. 13, 159/160). A young man who wants to marry a girl must also first make a bow and five different arrows for his future father-in-law. 24 If a warrior dies, his weapons are burned with him, so that he may use them on his journey to the moon and on the moon itself (see p.150)."
36	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	301 750 825	"Finally, it should be mentioned as a peculiarity that Surára and Pakidái men often glue the white down-feathers of the gavião-real ( Thrasaetus harpyia L.) -- koikoimão -- in the hair with tree resin. Usually they are arranged in the form of a wreath so that they give the effect of a head circlet (Ill. 9), but sometimes they are scattered through the hair at random. The ornamental idea, however, plays only a secondary role in this case, for this feather covering is regarded as a trophy. In the opinion of these Indians, sickness and evil in general come from hostile tribes, above all from the Waiká. They are caused by magical performances of the medicine men, who for this use these birds or bats as transmitters, in whose bodies they send their own souls. Now if the Surára and Pakidái kill such an animal, they believe that a hostile medicine man has at the same time met his end (see also pp.211 and 229)."
37	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	622 756 845	"If a complication arises during confinement, the chief, who is at the same time the witch doctor, is fetched."
38	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	276 533 753 755 756 776 884	"It is worth noting that the initiation rites of the male members of the tribe take place comparatively late, and that in this way all the men are gradually trained as medicine-man helpers. Through this, the Surára chief Hewemão explained to me, they are able to protect themselves and their families against sickness and accidents in an emergency. If, for example, a man is threatened along the way by a poisonous snake or a jaguar, he is now in a position to banish the danger by calling upon the tutelary spirits. He must never fail to thank the hekurá after a successful hunting expedition or a good harvest, however, for otherwise he would incur their anger. Even when his wife, one of his children, or a relative falls ill, he himself must first try, by means of song and dance in which he addresses the hekurá, to hurl the sickness back to the hostile tribe from which it was sent. Only if his efforts remain unsuccessful may he appeal for the aid of the chief, who is always willing and, with the help of 8-9 assistants, carries out a great rekurá (cure). Thus, during the day 68 or at night among the Surára and Pakidái one frequently sees one man, or often even several men, praying or attempting to cure a member of the family. Before that, however, they must take snuff-powder because contact with the hekurá can be made only in a state of intoxication. The songs are somewhat monotonous and are combined with animal sounds, animal movements, such as the beating of wings, [Page 145] 68 cont. hopping, etc. The other members of the tribe pay no attention to such prayers and magic performances. Only the chiefs and their student helpers sometimes listen more carefully. Then it sometimes happened that Hewemão would shake his head and tell me that this or that man was praying all wrong, he had undoubtedly not paid sufficient attention during the lessons. If he notes such deficiencies often, it may happen that he will request the man in question to take part in another two-month training course in order to increase his knowledge."
39	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	171 756 884	"There is evidence that this type of training, in similar form, occurs among the Jívaro, where prospective shamans receive instruction for one month, in the course of which the neophyte must also fast and drink various drugs, including tobacco juice and cayapi . The training costs, however, are very high 329 Stirling, 1938, pp. 117/18. . For the young Surára and Pakidái men the instruction is free, to be sure, but mandatory."
40	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	752 764	"Among the Pakidái I was able to be present on the sad occasion of a burial ceremony for the young, vigorous, and happy Hokotómarimá, an unmarried youth whose age was 19 years at most. He had fallen from the top of a pupunha palm ( Guilielma speciosa Mart.) (the liana lashing of his climbing apparatus, see p. 121, had evidently not been firm enough) and must have suffered internal injuries. All the efforts to save him, which were carried out uninterruptedly by the chief and his helpers for two days and nights, were unsuccessful."
41	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	171 224 225 262 751 825	"Of larger game the wild pig ( Pecari tajacu ) -- poxe -- is most often killed, and after that the tapir ( Tapirus americanus Briss.) -- xáma -- and a deer species ( Cervidae sp.) -- hajá . The [Page 162] 76 cont. meat of all the animals mentioned is greatly prized. Smaller rodents, however, are regarded as decided delicacies: paca ( Cuniculus paca L.) -- amutá -- and cutia ( Dasyprocta aguti L.) -- tomã --, which usually are killed with dogs or driven into a hole in the ground, as well as the armadillo ( Dasypodidae sp.) -- obó . The latter is killed in the following way: When the Indian has discovered an inhabitated armadillo burrow, he examines it to see whether the animal is occupying it. If this is the case, he quickly fetches dry leaves and blocks the entrance. Then he kindles a fire with his fire apparatus, which he always carries on the quiver (see p. 53), sets fire to the leaves, and, with a palm leaf, fans the smoke into the burrow. This forces the animal to come out after a few minutes, whereupon the hunter is able to kill it with an arrow or beat it to death with a stick 351 Caspar describes the same method for the Tuparí Indians (Caspar, 1953, p. 96 and Pl. 3). With somewhat less relish these Indians eat the meat of the capybara ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Erxl.) and the various monkey species, such as, for example, the howling monkey ( Alouatta sp.) -- ihró --, cuxiú-negro ( Chiroptes satanas Humb.) -- uixá --, cuatá ( Ateles paniscus L.) -- paxó --, and macaco-da-noite ( Aotus infulatus ) -- makurutamão . A great deal of skill, however, is required for monkey hunting in particular, because these animals leap from limb to limb in the crowns of tall trees and swing from one treetop to another by means of lianas. -- Feline species 352 Spotted jaguar ( Felis onca L.) -- ihrá --, black jaguar ( Panthera onca L.) -- hukumarí --, puma ( Felis concolor ) -- uaquearimã --, maracajá (Felis pardalis Neuw.) -- yaó . are shot [Page 163] 76 cont. relatively infrequently, for the most part only when they stay in the vicinity of a maloka and thus constitute a danger for human beings. Only the meat of the maracajá ( Felis pardalis Neuw.) is eaten. For some hunters, however, pride in killing such animals plays a role, for finishing off a jaguar, especially the black one, gives him greater esteem. -- Snakes, which are very numerous here because of the considerable dampness, are killed with a stick. If a surucucu ( Lachesis muta L.) -- pereíma -- (Surára word) -- peléma -- (Pakidái word), the largest and most dangerous poisonous snake of South America, is killed, then the joy is especially great. The head is cut off, and every family gets a piece of the snake's body, which is cooked with other meat. It has an agreeable taste and reminded me of eel. The Surára and Pakidái also believe, however, that every person who has eaten the neat of a surucucu will never be bitten by any other poisonous snake. The sucuriju ( Eunectes murinus ) -- uaikonyá -- and the jibóiavermelha ( Epicrates cenchris ) -- oatá -- are also eaten with relish. The jararaca ( Lachesis sp.) -- karihirimá --, the papaova ( Spilotes sp.) -- karimatá --, and the cobra-coral ( Elaps corallinus Wied,) -- huamoxíke --, on the other hand, are never eaten. -- Now and then a cayman ( Caiman sclerops Schneid.) -- ihuá -- or a lizard -- xaraimá -- are killed with a stick, and sometimes the hunter, but more often his dog, discovers in the forest a jabuti ( Testudo tabulata Woelb.) -- totorí --, whose meat is also very tender and tasty; 77 it does not come up to that of the water turtle, however. Yet, of the numerous species which inhabit the Demini, Aracá, and their tributaries, the Surára and Pakidái catch only the perma -- talmã --, and, to be sure, they seize it in shallow water with their hands."
42	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	223 237 753 825	"The gavião-real ( Thrasaetus harpyia L.) -- nonexí -- is killed for magical reasons, because it is believed that there is concealed in it a hostile medicine man who brings sickness and other disasters. Its down feathers are glued into the hair by the men as trophies (see p. 95); the meat is discarded. The gaviãocaipira ( Hypomorphnus urubitinga urubitinga Gm.) -- nonexipéke -- is also killed only for its feathers, which serve the men as upperarm ornaments."
43	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	171 237 753 754 825	"All sickness is attributed to hostile witch-doctors, especially those of the Waiká 493 The idea that sickness is caused by witch doctors is so widespread in South America that from the large number of examples I should like to quote only two authors for comparison: Roth, 1915, p. 346; Koch-Grünberg, 1923a, p. 192. . As carriers they use the gavião-real ( Thrasaetus harpyia L.) and the bat. Both animals are therefore designated generally as -- nonexí --, that is, evil spirit or spirit of sickness 494 Nonexí , however, is also the specific name of the gavião-real . 495 Zerries documents the same name, “ noneshi ” or “ nonish ,” for the Waiká. With it, however, they designate the shadow-soul or the alter ago (Zerries, 1958a, p. 108). . If such an animal is sighted, it is immediately killed, in order to prevent a misfortune. Moreover, it is assumed that with its death a hostile medicine man, who, of course, temporarily inhabits it, has breathed his last. The down feathers of the gavião-real are therefore glued into the hair for a few days as a trophy (see p. 95)."
44	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	171 755 774 776	"If a member of the tribe has fallen ill, he can be cured only by having the chief, who among the Surára and Pakidái is at the same time the medicine man, and his helpers try to hurl the sickness back to the enemies. This can be done, however, only in the snuff-powder intoxication and by invoking [Page 212] 96 cont. the hekurá , and best of all at night by moonlight 496 The hekurá are the intermediaries between human beings and the united Supreme Being Poré / Perimbó (see pp. 199 ff.). . All day long, usually one or two or sometimes even several men make preliminary attempts at healing. For all sicknesses there are very definite texts, melodies, and dance steps, which are taught the young men by their chief during a two-months' training course (see pp. 143/145). If the patient dies despite all efforts, the people yield to a certain fatalism, for in that case the power of the hostile medicine man was simply stronger 497 The same thing is reported by Koch-Grünberg about the Arekuná-Taulipang (Koch-Grünberg, 1923a, p. 202), Richard Schomburgk about the Warrau (Richard Schomburgk, 1847, p. 172), and Barrère as well as Quandt about the Galibi and Arowaken (Barrère, 1743, pp. 216/17; Quandt, 1807, p. 260), to mention only a few parallels. ."
45	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	171 755 757	"For the reasons mentioned, there is only suggestive therapy, supplemented by fasting and treatment with cold water. In the latter case a patient, even with the highest fever, must drink a great deal of water and take frequent baths in the nearby river or brook. He is also often exposed to pouring 97 rain (Ill. 49), since it is assumed that it has healing powers because it comes from the rain tree of the moon (see p. 199). Sick persons who are already too weak and are unable to leave their hammocks are doused with cold water at regular intervals 498 Treatment with cold water is widespread in South America. For comparison I should like to mention the Kaskihá Indians in the northeastern Chaco, among whom the witch doctor tries to heal the sick in the same way (Baldus, 1931, p. 143). ."
46	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	000 123 164 165 177 752 755 757	"During my nine-months' stay among the Surára and Pakidái the following sicknesses occurred there: grippe, pneumonia, malaria, chicken pox, and a gastric fever; fortunately, none was fatal 499 Only the Pakidái youth Hokotómarimá died after a fall from a pupunha palm, which probably caused internal injuries (see p. 149). . But the two Surára women who had pneumonia, first a young woman, Xunamí, the wife of Kurikayawö, the younger brother of the chief, and later an older woman, Xanimá, the approximately 47-year-old mother of Anyarawö (see pp. 123/125), and a boy, Xaniwö (see p. 127), about 12 years old, would probably not have survived without the penicillin that I had brought along, for, in spite of untiring treatment by the chief and his helpers, their condition grew worse from day to day. In the first instance, the chief, Hewemão, and the husband, Kurikayawö, finally permitted me to give Xunamí a penicillin injection in the upper arm on two successive days, whereupon she improved dramatically 500 This cure increased my reputation tremendously, so that afterward I was properly adopted into the tribe of the Surára and, on the occasion of the great festival in memory of the dead, was also permitted to drink the banana soup mixed with the bone ashes of deceased relatives (see p. 231). If the woman had died after the injection, however, the intervention could have had grave consequences for me. . In the second and third cases, [Page 214] 97 cont. the chief even asked me to give the patients “penicilina” after his healing efforts had again brought no success."
47	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	123 177 757	"Of the various cures at which I was allowed to be present, I should like to describe in detail the following two treatments:"
48	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	302 535 593 755 757	"Xunamí, the young, pretty wife of Kurikayawö, fell ill quite suddenly. She had a high fever, lay apathetically in her hammock, and complained of severe chest pains. Her husband, who, with touching devotion, remained with her throughout the first day, that is, he sat beside her or lay in his hammock, led her several times to the nearby small river, in which she always remained for some time and drank copious amounts. She was not permitted to eat anything, but she had no desire to do so. During the night, the fever seemed to climb, for she was quite delirious and unable to sleep soundly. The next day she felt even worse. Three times in the forenoon and as often in the afternoon her husband took her to the river, but there was no improvement after the baths and the drinking. At noon on the third day the husband, together with two other men, began the first special cure. First of all, Kurikayawö and the second participant painted serpentine lines on their faces and bodies with urucú, while the third one rubbed himself all over with soot. Then they all three blew snuff-powder into each other's noses and in a few minutes they were in a state of ecstasy in which they leaped wildly about the sick woman lying in her hammock, shouted loudly, and gesticulated. Then, however, the cure followed very definite directions. The man painted completely black symbolically represented the spirit of sickness -- nonexí -- whom a hostile medicine man had conjured into the body of the sick woman, and the other two men, who now identified themselves with the hekurá (see p. 200), staged a sham battle against him. At first they were armed with large sticks and beat “ nonexí ” in order to kill him. But he defended himself with all his might. Then he hurled arrows at him, which, however, he threw back. After that the 98 spirit of sickness stuck a carrying basket on his head, and this suddenly fell off. At once, the other two men [Page 215] 98 cont. beat quite hard upon the basket with their sticks, in order to give the sickness the finishing blow. All the movements were executed in a dance rhythm, two steps forward and one back, during which the “ hekurá ” uninterruptedly sang the words ho-he-hi-ha-ík , ho-he-hi-ha-ík , while “ nonexí ” uttered shrill sounds in between. At first the “battle” was enacted at some distance from the sick woman, but during the “argument” they drew nearer to her. “ Nonexí ” now danced alone at the head end of Xunamí, and the two “ hekurá ” stroked the body of the sick woman and sucked at it. Then they vomited, and one of them suddenly took a stone out of his mouth, and the other, a piece of wood. With shrill cries they threw these objects away, while “ nonexí, ” who was still at the head end of the patient, crouched down and started to whimper loudly. With the stone and the piece of wood the sickness was to be hurled back to the Waiká. Then the sham battle between “ nonexí ” and the “ hekurá ” began anew, frequently interrupted by the sucking and stroking of the body of the sick woman, who suffered everything indifferently. Meanwhile the men kept blowing snuff-powder into each other's noses. For four hours the treatment went on, but there was no improvement to be seen in Xunamí; rather, she grew worse. The sick woman was then set on the ground in front of her hammock, and two other men, this time only personified hekurá , continued the treatment in snuff-powder intoxication, in that they danced around the woman, sang, and screamed loudly. In between, they stroked Xunamí's body and sucked out little stones, which they spat upon, licked, and then rubbed against their own bodies before they hurled them away with shrill cries. Now and then they also struck out with hands and feet and threatened an invisible foe. Occasionally they spat and stepped on the sputum with gestures of repugnance. Then the patient was again placed in her hammock and doused with cold water."
49	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	755	"As a result of the high fever and long fasting, Xunamí was already very weak. But during the coming night a very great rekurá (magic cure; see also p. 211) was to be performed, and, to be sure, by Chief Hewemão and eight helpers. (The chief [Page 216] 98 cont. intervenes only if the day-cures of individual men have been unsuccessful.) Immediately after darkness set in, the men assembled, eight of whom, including the chief, had painted their faces and bodies with red serpentine lines, while the ninth was blackened with soot. A little to one side of the sick woman they formed a circle around the large clay plate standing in the center, upon which there was snuff-powder. They blew considerable amounts of this into each other's noses and then danced around in a circle, singing loudly and shouting. This, as the chief later explained to me, was to establish contact with the hekurá . These preparations lasted about half an hour. Then, dancing and singing, they drew nearer to the sick woman. This time she stood in front of her hammock, held by her husband, who had slipped his arms under hers and folded them over her chest, for she was no longer able to stand alone. Shouting loudly, the men danced around her several times and then leaped into the inner circle of the large, open maloka , where, in great rage, they hurled away invisible objects. Then they spat upon them and trampled furiously on these imaginary objects, at the same time uttering loud threats against the Waiká. After that they danced and leaped in apparent disorder back and forth between the sick woman, whose body they stroked a few times at each encounter, and the inner court of the maloka , during which they now and then shouted loudly, executed wild leaps, and at the same time turned in a circle. Whenever they came outside the dwelling part, they again tossed away invisible objects. This dancing, leaping, and shouting, the motions of 99 casting away, the bending of the knees, the pointing forward and upward with the hands seemed to be utter confusion, and the noise that went with it was indescribable. After that the chief and his brother danced alone for about 40 minutes around the sick woman, who meanwhile was being held by another man. They blew in her direction and sucked at her body, at the same time massaging it. By turns they leaped a few meters backward and threw away imaginary objects. -- Meanwhile the eight medicine-man helpers had moved away a bit from the hearth. The man blackened with soot lay on the ground, symbolically portraying the evil [Page 217] 99 cont. nonexí , while the other seven, who, exactly like the chief and his brother, identified themselves with the hekurá , danced and leaped around him. They kicked at him with their feet, uttered invectives, threatened him with their fists, and beat him. Suddenly, “ nonexí ” tried to flee, but the other men quickly caught up with him and threw the “evil spirit of sickness” to the ground again. They tapped his body, sucked at it, and spat over him. In fact, they even beat him symbolically with sticks. Then a stone weighing two kilograms was placed on the abdomen of “ nonexí, ” was picked up again after a short time, and was hurled away. At that the fiendish noise suddenly ceased. Chief Hewemão squatted before the sick woman, completely absorbed within himself. Behind him crouched his brother Kurikayawö, who stroked his body and head and lightly tapped his back. Complete silence prevailed; only the moaning of the chief and of the sick woman was to be heard, frequently interrupted by the loud sighs of the former. The other seven “ hekurá ” meanwhile squatted silently around the prostrate “ nonexí .” The sick woman now sat between the legs of the man who had hitherto supported her. After the chief had concentrated, which lasted about 30 minutes, all the participants in the rekurá formed a circle around Xunamí. The chief crouched directly opposite her, face to face with her, and commenced to sing loudly in a wonderful baritone voice, while the other eight men, with the exception of the “ nonexí ,” joined in chorus. It was a part song and so melodious that it sounded to me like an organ. Now and then the medicine-man helpers stood up and walked, singing, around the patient, while the chief stroked her body from head to foot, massaged her, tapped her, and sucked at her. Each time he would spit out imaginary objects, whereupon the other men always broke out in loud cries of “ oh ” and “ ah. ” This choral singing and the manipulations accompanying it lasted for about three hours. Then Hewemão sucked especially vigorously on Xunamí's body, while his hands kept stroking her downwards. All at once there was a stone weighing about one kilogram in his right hand, and three small stones, two pieces of wood, and two fingernails in his left. He had sucked all these [Page 218] 99 cont. objects out of her body and now hurled them away with gestures of disgust, amid the loud shouts of “ oh ” and “ ah ” by his helpers. During this sucking and stroking, the chorus of all the “ hekurá ” standing in a circle swelled to tremendous power and subsided only after Hewemão slowly withdrew, for his work was ended for the time being. He was bathed in sweat and, completely exhausted, lay down in his hammock, where his two wives provided him with a nourishing meal consisting of roasted tapir meat, manioc flat-cakes, and a bacaba drink."
50	"Becher, Hans, 1918-. The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	755 761	"The sick woman was not released, however, even after this five-hour cure. From 11:00 to 1:00 at night the husband and the medicine-man helpers continued it in the manner described above. The main thing was the choral singing and the dancing in step, with occasional sitting, stroking the sick woman, sucking, threatening hand movements toward an invisible opponent, spitting, etc. added. At 1:00 two more men dropped out, including the husband. The latter now lifted his wife up and laid her in her 100 hammock, then he crouched beside her and tenderly supported her head. For about another two hours the medicine-man helpers went on singing and “curing” and after that one alone until around 5:00. Only then could the sick woman surrender herself for a short time to a well-earned rest 501 If patients have become very much worse, they are kept awake as much as possible to prevent their life from escaping. For if they fall asleep, death might take possession of them. . Many other members of the tribe watched this magic performance, above all women, who wept softly during it. They crouched in a semicircle at a somewhat greater distance and watched the proceedings with rapt attention, but only as long as the chief was acting. When he finished his work, the spectators gradually disappeared."
51	"Becher, Hans, 1918-.  The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	123 177 755	"Unfortunately, all efforts remained unsuccessful in this case, and Hewemão confessed to me the next day, when the sick woman [Page 219] 100 cont. was much worse, that this time the power of the Waiká medicine men was extraordinarily great. I then proposed to him that I should give Xunamí penicillin injections. After lengthy consultations with the husband and other male members of the tribe he consented, though with misgivings, and luck was with the patient as well as with me. From this moment on the name penicilina (Portuguese spelling) became a magic word, for it had helped to cast away the sickness. Hewemão even asked me to bring him a great deal of it on my next visit."
52	"Becher, Hans, 1918-.  The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	164 755 757	"Xanimá, the approximately 47-year-old mother of Anyarawö (see p. 126), had been ill for five days with chicken pox and had had persistently high fever. At first she, too, was given the water cures, that is, she constantly had to take baths in the river and drink a great deal of water; as her weakness increased, she remained lying in her hammock and was doused with cold water. After that there were sham battles between two “ hekurá ” and the bad, black-colored spirit of sickness, “ nonexí .”"
53	"Becher, Hans, 1918-.  The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	276 302 533 535 755 821	"When there was no improvement, Chief Hewemão and eight helpers again arranged a large, nocturnal rekurá , but this time a somewhat different one, because, of course, a different sickness was involved 502 As has been mentioned above (see p. 212), every sickness has very definite texts, melodies, and dance steps. . At first the men, eight with red serpentine lines painted on their faces and bodies and one colored black, in the light of the hearth, again formed a circle around the large clay plate standing in the middle, on which snuff-powder had been poured. They filled their snuff tubes with generous amounts of it and blew it into each other's noses, whereupon, after a few minutes, the state of ecstasy set in. The men hopped around their own axis several times, and, after a hissing sound on the part of the chief and with prolonged shrill [Page 220] 100 cont. cries in the most diverse tones, they rushed toward the sick woman. They were like a wild horde, for the participants screamed at the top of their voices, bent their knees, leaped into the air, and shook their fists at an invisible foe. After a renewed hissing sound by Hewemão, they formed a circle around the sick woman lying in her hammock, and each man placed both hands on the shoulders of the one standing in front of him. With swaying dance steps, two forward and one back, during which they sang ho-he-hi-ha-ík , ho-he-hi-ha-ík , they walked around the patient for some time. Then Hewemão hissed for the third time, whereupon the song ceased. Then the chief struck up a melodious song which his helpers underscored with humming. Meanwhile, with swaying step, they continued to move around the sick woman, their hands always on the shoulders of the man in front as before. After 15 minutes Hewemão hissed again, and then they laid their hands crossed upon the shoulders of the one walking ahead. At the same time all the men joined in the song 101 of the chief, and again they sang in parts. This choral singing, together with the dancing in step, lasted another 20 minutes. Then the chief and his brother Kurikayawö placed themselves opposite each other at the head end of the patient and struck up an alternate song. At the foot end squatted two helpers who also faced each other and hummed softly. A short distance behind the head end two more helpers danced back and forth with faces turned toward each other; they were also humming, and occasionally they uttered bird-like sounds; they frequently ran their fingers through their hair and then always passed them downward over their seats. Meanwhile the other three men, two painted red, the one black-colored, that is to say, two “ hekurá ” and “ nonexí ,” were carrying on a sham battle beyond the foot end of Xanimá, in a manner similar to that already descríbed on page 216. In the meantime the daughter-in-law of the sick woman had raised her up and had seated herself behind her in the hammock, at the same time supporting the old woman with both arms. Then when the sham combat was ended, and the bad “ nonexí ” lay on the [Page 221] 101 cont. ground and the two “ hekurá ” crouched beside him as “victors,” a part song by all the participants began once more. At the same time the chief stroked the head and then the body of the sick woman. Then he started to suck at her, first at her head, then on the chest, on the stomach, and on the thighs. Then he uttered shrill cries and vomited. At this moment the singing ceased and all the helpers uttered loud cries of “ ah ” and “ oh .” Thereupon Hewemão hurled invisible objects to one side, which was always accompanied by ah and oh shouts of the other men. Then a chorus was struck up anew. This part of the magic performances lasted more than two hours. After the chief had sucked stones and pieces of wood out of the body of the sick woman and hurled them away amid animated cries of ah and oh by the helpers, however, the volume of the singing increased and was followed by shrill cries which ended in a general humming. -- After that there was complete silence. The men sat down in a circle around Xanimá, and each one leaned his head against his knees, for all were visibly exhausted, especially the chief and his brother. The wives of the latter, however, had seated themselves behind them and stroked their heads and shoulders and gently tapped their backs in order to give the weary ones new strength, for during the curing process they had completely spent themselves. The sick woman, too, could now lie down again. She had her eyes closed and one could see how exhausted she was from sitting up so long. After the noise that had been going on, the stillness had a very strange effect. But after only 15 minutes one of the medicine-man helpers arose; he began dancing in a circle around the sick woman, during which he softly sang. Meanwhile, however, clouds had passed before the moon and a heavy rain set in. Hewemão then decided to break off the session and continue it at dawn. “For with a darkened sky,” he said, “without the co-operation of the moon, it would be impossible to free the woman from her sickness.” He left behind with the moaning Xanimá, shaken with fever chills, two helpers who crouched to the right and left of her head end and hummed softly, in order that, as Hewemão told [Page 222] 101 cont. me, contact with the hekurá would not be broken. Toward 4:30, the rain had stopped in the meantime, the nine men once more gathered around the sick woman and continued the cure for another two hours in the manner described above. By forenoon the fever was gone and the woman was on the way to recovery. She and every other member of the tribe were convinced that Hewemão had hurled the evil spirit of sickness, nonexí , back to the Waiká. Even Hewemão himself firmly believes that in the snuff-powder intoxication and with the help of the hekurá and the moon he is able to ward off sickness and accidents and to cast them out."
54	"Becher, Hans, 1918-.  The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	126 533 535 755	"102 The two above-described magic performances for warding off two different diseases show a certain external pattern. Each cure begins with the taking of snuff-powder, which causes the chief and his helpers to fall into a state of ecstasy and to identify themselves with the hekurá . There follows the invocation of the hekurá , which is reinforced by wild gestures, then the sham struggle between two or more “ hekurá ” and the spirit of sickness, “ nonexí .” After that, very definite texts, melodies, and dances are used for each sickness. Unforgettable for me are the choral part-songs which contain the requests to the hekurá and the serras , who, in turn, relay them to Poré/Perimbó (see pp.197 ff.) 503 I deeply regret that I was unable to record these songs on a sound track. Unfortunately, the tape recorder which the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft had sent by courier to the German Consulate in São Paulo before the start of my expedition was damaged by an employee there. Without permission, he had unpacked it and tinkered with it. Thus, I can only hope that on a subsequent expedition I shall have an opportunity to record these songs. ."
55	"Becher, Hans, 1918-.  The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	123 431 622 755 756	"I was allowed to take part as a spectator in all the cures, and each rekurá was a new, great experience for me. I was amazed at the devotion, passion, and fervor with which the chief and his helpers interceded with all their physical and psychic powers to ward off the sicknesses of their fellowtribesmen 504 The same care was bestowed upon me, the stranger. If I had an attack of malaria, the chief and his helpers likewise danced around me, and they sang in chorus while Hewemão stroked my body, massaged it, and sucked at it. He was of the opinion that the Waiká had poisoned my blood because I lived in friendship with the Surára and had brought them so many beautiful gifts. . This explains why the Surára and Pakidái have such boundless confidence in their chiefs and are absolutely convinced of their magic powers. It is doubtless due to this unshakable faith that so many of the sick can be cured 505 I never saw the chiefs demand a fee for their cures. The members of the tribe show their appreciation, however, by continuously offering their chiefs larger or smaller gifts (see p.130). ."
56	"Becher, Hans, 1918-.  The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	114 755 756	"In this context I should like to cite the following very revealing description by Herbert Baldus: “The witch doctors were simply called imposters by early travelers, and even today all whites who are incapable of understanding the mentality of the Indian are of the same opinion. One forgets that, as a result of the suggestibility of the primitive, the magic practices not only essentially help the sick person and rid his relatives of their fears, but also weave such a spell around the practitioner himself that it is impossible to decide to what extent he is acting in good [Page 224] 102 cont. faith and to what extent he is faking” 506 Baldus, 1931, p. 142. . The fact that even in modern medicine great importance is now attributed to the suggestive influence of the physician on his patients is shown in the following statements by Hans Grimm: “If we emphasize that the suggestive influence of the physician's personality on the patient is often of decisive influence (Jores), if we use hypnosis, the so-called ‘autogenous training,’ etc., we are, in our own way, returning to what was already playing a role in shamanistic techniques” 507 Grimm, 1958/59, p. 357. ."

The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	301 302 522 751 769 782 788	"Poréhiwö now poured bone ashes from one after another of the small jamaru vessels into the empty gourd bowls, added a little urucú, mixed the two with his hands, and gave the bowl to Karenauö, who each time poured the contents into one of the larger jamaru vessels. While the two Pakidái were silently performing their work, Hewemão was praying in a half-singing [Page 230] 105 cont. voice to the hekurá and constantly passed his hands from his head to his feet. His brother Kurikayawö repeated each of his words and imitated the gestures 511 This was again the symbolic transmission of the prayers from the hekurá to Poré/Perimbó (see also p. 228). . Around the four men, who were now officiating as priests, crouched red-painted warriors whose head hair was completely covered with the down feathers of the gavião-real . Whenever the Pakidái chief poured a new mixture of bone ashes and urucú into a larger jamaru vessel, he always pulled a few feathers from the heads of the warriors and threw them in 512 There is defensive magic connected with this. For if the men, in the subsequent ceremonial drinking of the banana soup mixed with bone ashes, swallow these feathers, they and their families are better protected against sickness. . The closest relatives of the late deceased sat behind the warriors and sobbed heart-rendingly, especially the women. Their tears 106 flowed uninterruptedly, and at the same time they prayed in a low, singing cadence. When the bone ashes of another jamaru vessel were mixed with urucú by Poréhiwö, their sobbing and their prayers changed to high, shrill tones. This made no impression upon the medicine men, however, who imperturbably went on with their activity. The mourners were surrounded by a circle of standing warriors painted red and adorned with upper-arm feathers, who held bows and arrows in their hands and faced outward. It was their task to shield the ceremony against harmful outside influences. Behind them stood numerous male spectators, who followed the proceedings with interest, to be sure, but without inner participation, for at times they laughed and joked."

The Surara and Pakidai, two Yanoama tribes in northwest Brazil"	754 824 825	"A magic powder is occasionally prepared from the bark ashes of a wild mimosa species ( Mimosa acacioides ?)-- hekuráhihená --(see also p. 192) and the bone powder of the gavião-real ( Thrasaetus harpyia L.). In the evening, shortly before twilight sets in, if a gavião-real happens to be flying by or is sitting on a tree, the chief blows this powder in the direction of the bird. The latter receives it and with it transmits sickness to a specific hostile tribe."

Then, before he sets out the next morning, he paints serpentine lines on his face and body with urucú. If his wife accompanies him, she also applies this design, and the snout and feet of a dog that is taken along are painted with the same color. This is supposed to increase the luck of the hunt and is at the same time bound up with defensive magic against possible dangers threatened by poisonous snakes and jaguars."

When he reaches a matamatá tree ( Eschweilera matamata Hub.) from which 112 drops are falling, he lays the palm lead under the tree. He leaves it there until it has rotted. Out of it comes a worm which the man later fetches and then roasts. If he throws this upon the sleeping woman, she will have no more children."

Although these Indians very rarely come in contact with caboclos , and in most cases only the men, both sexes have at their command a rather large store of Portuguese words and figures of speech. One little Surára boy about nine years old, Jubeauwö, also called Mandú, who had spent almost two years in the hut of the palm-fiber gatherer Manuel Antonio Gómez on the Rio Aracá, had a nearly perfect command of the Portuguese language and performed unique service as my interpreter. I owe it to him alone that I was able to penetrate more deeply into the mental culture of the Surára and Pakidái and put together a complete vocabulary 564 Three years ago the little boy suffered dangerous burns on the abdomen by an upset vessel containing boiling tree resin. Since the chief had given up hope that he would recover, he wanted to have him given the deathblow. The custom of this tribe, as well as that of the Pakidái, decrees that all old and seriously ill persons who are no longer able to take part in the general migrations must be killed (see pp. 153/154). The grandmother of the little boy, who is an orphan took him secretly one night to the hut of the Spanish palm-fiber gatherer, Manoel Antonio Gomez, who succeeded in saving his life. The chief was said to have been very angry at first over the arbitrary action of the grandmother, but then, when he saw that the little one had recovered, he calmed down. . [Page 259] 118 cont. Most men, after but a short time, had no difficulty handling our two guns; a few were soon even operating the outboard motor, and the Surára chief Hewemão, who showed great interest in my camera, took very acceptable pictures with it. The reasoning power seems to be somewhat more strongly developed among the men than among the women 565 This conclusion agrees with an observation by Baldus among the Tumerehã, and the scholar adds a remark which could also be applied to the Surára and Pakidái: “The differences in the talents of the sexes are perhaps the result of their way of life and division of labor. Thus, among the Tumerehã, the man's way of acquiring food has probably developed his acuteness, for he does not merely gather fruits, like the woman, but also goes hunting...” (Baldus, 1931, p. 119). ."

At this time Matakuwä's group was on friendly terms with the residents of Patanowä-täka (who are now living in three distinct villages and constitute the groups from whom most of my data were taken). On one of their visits, the residents of Patanowä-täka found Nabäyoma in the woods outside Matakuwä's village and took her home with them when they left after visiting. [Page 23] At Patanowä-täka she was given to Husiwä, by whom she had two sons (Orakuwä and Kariunawä). The approximate date of her move to Patanowä-täka is 1935; it could not be much later, because a war broke out between Matakuwä's group and the group at Patanowä-täka shortly after this date, and no visitors went between these two villages after hostilities commenced."

By contrast, the Siriono have 8, the Andamanese 10, the Jivaro 22, the Nuer 28, the Siuai 39, the Iroquois 64, the Bemba 100 and the Tahitians 140. (Carneiro and Tobias, 1963:201.)

Young bachelors, for example, practice sodomy ( bei kä bosi kuwemou, bei kä bosi waumou ) with each other. These relationships develop into a ‘buddy’ system ( äawä ) and promote ties of friendship that extend into adult life.

In fact, most of these bachelors joked about it and simulated copulation with each other in public. The men involved in these affairs, however, were hardly more than teenagers; I have no cases of adult men satisfying their sexual needs by homosexuality. By the time a young man is 20 to 25 years old, his sexual interests focus on women, and he is constantly attempting to establish liaisons with women, whether or not they have husbands. In some respects, a man's status depends on his ability to successfully carry on clandestine affairs which, when discovered, force him into club-fights. The number of scars he has on his scalp is a measure of his sexual prowess."
87	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö warfare, social organization and marriage alliances"	152 753 761 774 825	"Ferocity and violence is further reflected in Yanomaö cosmology. In their conception, the human soul has three parts. One of these parts, the noreshi , is capable of leaving the body; when it does so, the person becomes ill and dies unless it (the noreshi ) returns. The noreshi are inherited patrilineally for males and matrilineally for females. Each human noreshi has an animal or bird counterpart whose life is coextensive and coterminous with that of the human to which it corresponds. Many of the noreshi are types of animals commonly taken by hunters. Thus, when the Yanomaö kill game animals, they believe they also kill the human being to whom that noreshi corresponds. 1 They are not concerned about killing their own noreshi , for humans and their noreshi animals live in complementary distribution. Hence, hunting in the eyes of the Yanomaö is behaving fiercely, for every noreshi animal killed also results in the death of some human, usually an enemy."

Sibarariwä's followers, along with a party of men from Hasaböwä-tedi, were concealed in the jungle outside Riakowä's village. Shortly after arriving at the village, the Kreiböwei-tedi men were attacked by Riakowä's men with sharpened staves and axes, and eleven of them were killed. Those that managed to break out of the palisades were shot from ambush by Sibarariwä's followers, along with the Hasaböwä-tedi, resulting in the wounding of a large number of Kreiböwei-tedi men. Only six or seven women were seized by the Shamatari; but, the greediness of the Shamatari [Page 159] men for the Kreiböwei-tedi women distracted the Shamatari, and a large number of Kreiböwei-tedi managed to escape. These fled to a mountain called Wadubadidiobakäkö where they had previously started clearing a new garden, Kobou-täka. Here, the Kreiböwei-tedi removed the arrow-points from the wounded and regained their health. They returned to Kreiböwei-täka, as their new garden had not yet begun producing. Shortly after the treacherous feast the Kreiböwei-tedi were visited by Shinanokawä, the headman of Mahekodo-tedi, and one of his followers, Shiroba-tedi. The two men had heard of the Kreiböwei-tedi's unfortunate circumstances and visited them to extend an invitation to join Mahekodo-tedi while they made a new garden."

A major point of difference is that among the former warfare is much less common than it is among the Yanomamö described in the preceding chapters. It is likely that this reduction in warfare is partly due to more frequent contact of the Brazilian Yamomaö with Carib-speaking Indian tribes (Makiritare and Arekuna) and, since 1958, with Christian missions. There appears to be a cline in the decreasing intensity of warfare from southwest, the area in which I conducted my field work, to northeast, the area from which these new data are drawn (see Map D, next page). Yanomamö from the Upper Padamo River, an area about on the mid-point of this cline, told me that fighting with clubs was very rare in their villages. Migliazza 1 Personal communication. asserts that raiding between villages on the Uraricoera River occurs only every four or five years and is usually provoked by [Page 194] [Page 195] accusations of sorcery or by the desire to abduct woemn."

Yanomamö: the fierce people"	484 752	"The jungle provides a number of hazards to the barefoot traveler in that most species of palm have long, sharp spines protruding from their trunks or leaf stems. The most common and recurrent injury the Yanomamö sustain is thorns in the feet. A party of ten men can rarely travel an hour without one of them stopping to extract a thorn from his foot. This is always accompanied by hisses and clicks of pain on the part of the victim, who gouges the thorn out with either an arrow point or another thorn. Their feet have thick calluses on them, but because the trails frequently cross streams and swamps, the calluses soften and are easily pierced by thorns."
93	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	165 484 752	"Another, but rarer, hazard is snakes. 2 Two percent of all adult deaths are due to snake bite; 54 percent are due to malaria, and other epidemic diseases (Chagnon 1966) and 24 percent of adult males die in warfare. There are always a few cases of snake bite in each village every year, although few of them are fatal. Most snake-bite victims recover from the wound with no ill side effects. I treated two cases of snake bite that were like this. But a few bites are severe enough to cause the loss of a limb. One of my better acquaintances, a young man of some thirty years, lost a leg because of a snake bite when he was about fifteen years old, and will spend the rest of his life hopping on one leg, a form of locomotion he has mastered so thoroughly that he almost manages to keep up with the group when they visit other villages."

They sometimes throw long sticks and brush on the roof to keep the wind from blowing the leaves away, but their major defense is magic: when a strong breeze comes up, the shamans rush to the center of the village, wave their arms frantically, and shout incantations to Wadoriwä, the spirit of the wind, enjoining him to stop blowing the leaves off the roof."

Orasimi, Ka aobawä's brother's daughter, making a bammock for trade with allies . while other plants allegedly cure the same evils. Ka aobawä's followers do not cultivate many of these malevolent magical plants; they claim, however, that the “Waikas” 8 The Yanomamö are sometimes referred to in the literature by such designations as Shiriana, Xiriana, Guaharinbo, and Waika. The first three terms are foreign words meaning “howler monkey” and have been applied to the Yanomamö by their northern neighbors, the Carib-speaking Makiritare Indians. A good deal of the early infomation came from the quite unreliable accounts travelers obtained from the Makiritare. The term “ Waika, ” however, from the verb waikaö, is a Yanomamö word meaning “to kill an animal (or man) that is already dying from a wound.” Zerries (1964) used the term “ Waika ” in much the same sense that I am using the term “Yanomamö.” Waika, however, is very ambiguous and imprecise. For example, members of village “A” will assert that members of village “B” are “Waikas.” If you ask members of village “B” if they are Waikas, however, they will deny it and say they are Yanomamö, adding that the members of village “C” are Waikas. When you question members of village “C,” you will get the same answer: The Waikas live in the next village, only Yanomamö live here. Nevertheless, the term does have currency in the villages near the headwaters of the Orinoco River. One of my informants claimed that the blood of “Moon” (see the third section of this chapter) changed into Waikas, but they became extinct because they were so fierce. He also asserted that the Waikas were Yanomamö. use them extensively and blow harmful charms at their enemies through hollow tubes. The failure of Ka aobawä's group to use magical plants in this fashion is cited as a distinguishing [Page 39] feature that sets it aside from other groups of Yanomamö. Many wild plants are also said to have magical properties."

A long time ago, after the earth layer was formed by a piece of hedu , another chunk of hedu fell down and crashed through earth. It hit earth at a place where the Amahiri-teri lived, carrying their village down to the bottom layer. Unfortunately, only their sbabono and gardens were carried with the piece of hedu . Hence, the Amahiri-teri have no neighborhood ( uribi ) in which to hunt for game, and so they send their spirits up to earth to capture the souls of living children and eat them. There is a constant struggle between the evil spirits of Amahiri-teri shamans and the evil spirits of shamans on this layer, earth: They send malevolent demons against each other and preoccupy themselves with defending their respective villages from evil spirits."
97	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	753 773 829	"It is because the foreigners refused to climb the mountains to escape the flood that they became enemies to the Yanomamö. The foreigners tried to make friends with the Yanomamö after the flood, but because their language was so different, the Yanomamö refused to be friends. Today, however, the Yanomamö are becoming friends with foreigners."

Sickness results when the noreshi has left the body; unless it is brought back soon, the person will die. The noreshi is the vulnerable portion of the complete being, the part that is the target of witchcraft and harmful magic. The shamans ( shabori ) wage constant war against the evil demons ( hekura ) of enemy groups who have been sent to capture the noreshi parts of children. They, in turn, send their own hekura to capture the noreshi of enemy children; the wars that take place between men who raid to kill are likewise carried over into the domain of the supernatural."
99	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	114 755 774 825	"When sickness is deemed to be the result of soul loss, the people who are closely related to the sick person hunt for his noreshi . I participated in one of these soul hunts. Ka aobawä's group had set up a temporary camp across the river from its main village site, as they suspected raiders would attack them. While they were camped in their temporary village, one of the children became ill, and her malady was thought to be caused by soul loss. When the threat of raiders passed, the temporary camp was abandoned and the group moved back into the main village."
100	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	114 755 774 825	"The child's condition worsened, so a group of women and children returned to the temporary camp, suspecting that the noreshi had remained there. I went along and, with the others, cut a branch from a shrub and began sweeping the site and calling for the noreshi to return. We swept the entire area and converged at one point. Everybody was convinced that the noreshi had been herded into this central point. We then lured the noreshi back across the river and into the body of the sick child."

Yanomamö: the fierce people"	123 126 177 756 769 774 825	"The vulnerability of the noreshi to magical spells is best examplified by the fact that the shamans of every village spend most of their time chanting to the hekura (demons) with the intention of persuading them either to attack the noreshi of other (enemy) children or to drive off the hekura sent by enemy shamans. Again, the Yanomamö used two of their concepts of the soul to describe photographs and tape recordings. They were very hostile to me when I attempted to take photographs, especially of children, because [Page 50] I, in effect, was capturing the noreshi of the child: A photograph was called noreshi . 13 Many informants gave a more pragmatic explanation of their fear of the camera. They did not want to be reminded of their dead kinsman, and if I had a photograph of the person, this would be an extremely offensive reminder to his relatives that their loved one was dead. Tape recordings, in contrast, were not considered to be harmful. If anything, they enjoyed having me record their music and discussions, and always demanded that I play them back for everyone to hear. The word used to describe a recording was no uhudibö , the part of the soul that wanders in the jungle after the body is cremated. In short, only the noreshi aspect of the soul is vulnerable."

After several months, an old man is appointed to strip the remaining decayed flesh from the bones and the bones are then cremated.

Members of allied villages show their friendship to each other by sharing, in the ashes of particularly important people, in a very intimate act. Endocannibalism, to the Yanomamö, is the supreme form of displaying friendship and solidarity."
105	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	754 756	"The nature of the relationship between man and spirit is largely one of hostility. The shamans, by and large, spend most of their time casting charms on enemies and enjoining their own personal demons to prevent harm from befalling the local people. Magic and curing are intimately bound up in shamanism, the practitioner devoting his efforts alternatively to causing and curing sickness."
106	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	756 776	"The demons that the shamans contact are hekura , very tiny humanoid beings that well on rocks and mountains. Particularly successful shamans can control these demons to such an extent that the hekura will come and live inside the chest of the shaman. Each shaman solicits the aid of numerous hekura and attempts to lure them into his body."
107	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	621 756 785	"Men who want to become shamans ( shabori ) go through a simple rite of fasting and chastity. They sit before their houses, use only a few trails, eat very little, and spend most of their time in a contemplative stupor brought about by hunger and drugs. After several days of this, the initiate has entered the world of the shabori , and can practice his skill. Each village has as many shabori as there are men who wish to enter this status: probably half of the men in each village are shamans."
108	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	756 834 853	"Rerebawä told me that he was going to become a shabori , as he enjoyed taking the drugs and making contact with the spirit world. He decided to do this because his wife is still nursing their youngest child so that he cannot have sexual relationships with her anyway; the obligatory chastity associated with becoming a shaman will not be as difficult now as it would be when his wife weans the child. No hekura will dwell in the chest of a novice shabori who continues to have sexual relationships. After the practitioner has captured the hekura and they become acquainted with him, they will stay in his chest after he resumes his sexual activities."
109	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	276 755 756 757 787	"Contact with the hekura is achieved by taking drugs. Particularly adept shabori can contact their hekura with only a pinch of drug, which they inhale directly from their fingers. Most of them, however, take a large dose of the drug by means of the hollow blowing tube. The shabori then prances back and forth in front of his house and chants to the demons he attempts to control, enjoining them to descend on enemies and cause them sickness (see Fig. 2-9). If he is curing someone, he chants before the house of the patient, rubs him, massages him, and draws the evil spirit causing the sickness to some extremity, such as an arm or leg. Then he sucks or pulls the spirit out and carries it away from the sick person, either vomiting it out or throwing it away, depending on how he extracted it originally. The Yanomamö do not employ medicines made from plants or animals. Consequently, they rely exclusively on the cures that the shabori effect, fighting supernatural ills with supernatural medicine."
110	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	123 756	"One of the surprises of my field experience was that I had to spend a great deal of time curing the sick, and my medicines were always in demand. The sick people, however, always took their illnesses to the shabori after I had treated them--one cannot be too careful."
111	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	123 750 753 755 761 774 854 858	"Finally, the children differ from adults in their susceptibility to supernatural hazards. A great deal of Yaanomamo sorcery and mythological references to harmful magic focuses on children as the target of malevolence. Yanomamö shamans are constantly sending evil spirits ( Hekura ) to enemy villages. There, they secretly attack and devour the vulnerable portion of the childrens' souls ( noreshi ), bringing about sickness and death These same shamans spend an equal amount of time warding off the dangerous spirits sent by their enemies. Children are vulnerable because their souls are not firmly established within their physical beings, and can wander out of the body almost at will. The [Page 86] most common way for a child's soul to escape is to leave by way of the mouth when the child cries. Thus, mothers are quick to hush a bawling baby in order to prevent its soul from escaping. The child's soul can be recovered by sweeping the ground in the vicinity where it most probably escaped, calling for it while sweeping the area with a particular kind of branch. I once helped gather up the soul of a sick child in this fashion, luring it back into the sick baby. One of the contributions I made, in addition to helping with the calling and sweeping, was a dose of medicine for the child's diarrhea. A consequence of this set of attitudes about the vulnerability of children is that much of the village's activity with respect to shamanism and curing is directed toward the children."
112	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	512 537 578 593 755 765	"Things are not always quiet after dark. If anyone in the village is sick, a shaman will chant to the malevolent spirits most of the night to exorcise them. Or, should anyone be mourning a dead kinsman, he or she will sob and wail long after the others have fallen asleep. Occasionally, a fight will break out between a husband and wife, and soon everybody in the village will be screaming, expressing opinions on the dispute. The shouting may continue sporadically for hours, dying down only to break out anew as someone gets a fresh insight into the problem. Once in a while someone gives a long, loud speech voicing his opinion on the world in general. Those who are interested may add their own comments, but the audience usually grumbles about the noise and falls asleep."
113	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	302 515 574 628 754 755 776	"The men of the host group had finished their preparations for the feast; they were all painted in red and black, bearing colorful feathers. They had cleaned the debris from their houses, had finished hauling out the weeds they had picked from the village clearing, and had brought in quantities of food to give their guests. Now, it was time for them to take ebene , their hallucinogenic drug. They separated into several groups and began blowing the brownish-green powder up each other's nostrils with 3-foot long hollow tubes. As the drug would be administered, each recipient would reel from the concussion of air, groan, and stagger off to some convenient post to vomit. Within ten minutes of taking the drug, the men would be bleary-eyed and wild, prancing around in front of their houses, stopping occasionally to vomit or to catch their breath. In each group there would be one man particularly adept at chanting to the hekura , the mountain demons, and he would soon take over the show, while the others retired to the sidelines in a stupor, green slime dripping from their nostrils. Should there be sick people in the village, the adept chanters--the shabori --would cure them by chanting, massaging, sucking, and vomiting out the evil spirit that caused the sickness. Otherwise, they would chant about other things, perhaps sending their hekura to enemy villages to eat the souls of children, or enjoining them to prevent their enemies from doing the same. Occasionally, one of the men takes too much of the drug and become violent. On this particular occasion, Shiimima, one of Ka aobawä's brothers, grabbed his bow and arrows and ran to the center of the village. This caused a minor sensation for a moment, but one of the men managed to catch and disarm him, hiding his weapons so he could not find them. Things returned to normal again, and the other participants in the drug-taking began chanting to Shiimima to restore him to his senses. The chanting lasted for an hour or so, and the participants, one by one, returned to their houses to clean up their paint jobs; most of them had smeared their careful work by vomiting all over themselves."
114	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	628 721 754	"T HE FEAST AND ALLIANCE can and often do fail to establish stable, amicable relationships between sovereign villages. When this happens, the groups may coexist for a period of time without any overt expressions of hostility. This, however, is an unstable situation, and no two villages that are within comfortable walking distance from each other can maintain such a relationship indefinitely: They must become allies, or hostility is likely to develop between them. Indifference leads to ignorance or suspicion, and this soon gives way to accusations of sorcery. Once the relationship is of this sort, a death in one of the villages will be attributed to the malevolent hekura sent by shamans in the other village, and raids will eventually take place between them."
115	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-. Yanomamö: the fierce people"	562 602 721 726 727 754	"Generally, however, the desire to abduct women does not lead to the initiation of hostilities between groups that have had no history of mutual raiding in the past. New wars usually develop when charges of sorcery are leveled against the members of a different group. Once raiding has begun between two villages, however, the raiders all hope to acquire women if the circumstances are such that they can flee without being discovered. If they catch a man and his wife at some distance from the village, they will more than likely take the woman after they kill her husband. If, however, the raiders are near the village, they may flee without dragging a captured woman along, as the body of their victim will be discovered quickly and pursuit will be immediate. Hence, they do not take a chance on hindering their flight by dragging a reluctant captive with them. A captured woman is raped by all the men in the raiding party and, later, by the men in the village who wish to do so but did not participate in the raid. She is then given to one of the men as a wife. If the captured woman is related to her captors, she is not raped."

Ka aobawä's pains had gotten so bad that he decided to turn back just before they reached the Patanowä-teri village. He could barely walk by that time and would not have been able to elude pursuers should the enemy have given chase. Shararaiwä, his brother, decided to accompany him back lest he run into a group of Patanowä-teri hunters, or his condition grow even more severe. Shortly after they had dropped out of the raiding party, Shararaiwä stepped on a snake and was bitten. The rains had started, and the snakes were beginning to concentrate on the higher grounds, making walking a hazard. His leg began to swell immediately, and he could not walk. Hence, Ka aobawä had to carry him out on his back, despite the fact that he could barely walk himself. Carrying him for nearly two days, he managed to reach the Orinoco River. Here, he intended to make a bark canoe and float the rest of [Page 133] the way back down, but they located a dugout canoe someone had concealed, 3 The canoe was hidden in the brush by Ka aobawä's son-in-law, who lives in a village up the Orinoco. He had come to Bisaasi-teri that day to visit and hid his canoe so that the Bisaasi-teri would not borrow it. so they borrowed this and reached home about dark, three days after Shararaiwä had been bitten. He survived the snake bite, but Ka aobawä was very exhausted from the trip."

They had removed the arrow, but he was very weak and continuously coughed up mouthfuls of blood. They put him in a hammock and tended his fire for him. They asked me to treat his wound."
118	"Chagnon, Napoleon A., 1938-.  Yanomamö: the fierce people"	727 758	"He lay in his hammock for a week, not eating or drinking all that time--the Yanomamö have a taboo against taking water when wounded with a bamboo-type arrow, and Konoreiwä was slowly wasting away. Finally, I could stand it no longer and made a batch of lemonade. I called for them to gather around, ceremoniously crushed an aspirin into the lemonade, and explained that this was very powerful medicine. So powerful that it had to be diluted with a large amount of water. I then demanded that he take some, which he gladly did, the others not interfering. By then he was so weak that he could not sit up, so I spoon-fed the liquid to him. A knowing glance passed between us as he gulped down the first spoonful of sweet liquid. He ultimately recovered."

Upon their return, they brought information that the Marashiteri lived upstream. At that time the Kaserapai were dying from infectious disease acquired on downstream trips. To explain this sickness and death, they initially speculated that they resulted from Marashiteri witchcraft. They journeyed upstream to confront this village of about 80 people, but the Marashiteri persuaded them that the witchcraft emanated from the Shiriteri. Friendly relationships developed between the Mucajai and Marashiteri villagers and marriage exchange began in 1966. Twenty-one percent of the in-migrants came from this group."

They include 19 adults (6 men and 13 women of whom 4 were widows finding remarriage difficult in their own villages) and 9 children who came with the 4 widows. For Mucajai men, the reason for [Page 67] seeking outside marriage was the lack of females within the group with the correct kinship status. Some men had wife-sharing arrangements as secondary husbands but wanted marriage as primary husbands. In two of the marriages Mucajai and Paramiteri men exchanged their sisters. One woman was stolen from her Paramiteri family by a Mucajai man. All 13 new wives came to live in the Mucajai community without the Mucajai men spending several years of bride service with the bride's family. The Mucajai men preferred to remain in their own villages with their kin and not to be burdened with the mother-in-law avoidance patterns. The families of the wives agreed to a short period of bride service because of the trade goods the Mucajai men were able to provide them and because of the prestige of the Mucajai group. In addition, medical assistance was available at Mucajai. The Mucajai people were known as an industrious group who were willing to work hard and to provide for their families, while some other groups had a reputation for laziness. During the postcontact period, no Mucajai male has out-migrated for marriage."

At the time of contact there were five captive women in the population. In the postcontact period, Mucajai groups have been involved in four raids against other Yanomama groups. In 1959 there was much infectious disease. The resulting sickness and death was a new and frightening experience for the Mucajai community. In their efforts to explain what was happening, the Mucajai asked the Marashiteri. The Marashiteri said that the Shiriteri were performing witchcraft against the Mucajai. Since the Mucajai people had no contact with the Shiriteri and did not consider them enemies, they visited them to get an explanation. The Marashiteri acted as guides. The Marashiteri then warned the Shiriteri about hostile intentions of the Mucajai people, even though the Mucajai had not yet made any judgments about the Shiriteri. It appears that the Marashiteri were manipulating both groups for their own unknown purposes. When the Shiriteri showed themselves suspicious and reserved toward the Mucajai group and refused to give the customary offerings of food for visitors, the Mucajai people saw this as proof of the accusations made by the Marashiteri. The two [Page 68] visiting groups, the Mucajai and the Marashiteri, changed into a raiding party and attacked the Shiriteri. One Shiriteri was shot with a gun, one was killed by his own knife, and two were mortally stabbed with bamboo arrow tips. The Mucajai took three women captives and the Marashiteri seized two. Years later the Mucajai sent presents to the surviving Shiriteri relatives of their captive wives as a goodwill gesture."

In a Mucajai village a woman had died suddenly. Later a Catrimani man visited the village and said that he was responsible for the witchcraft which had killed her. He also insulted the Mucajai group by saying they were “not fierce.” These events inflamed an already existing animosity against the Catrimani. The Aica brother-in-law of a prominent Mucajai man had been killed in a raid by the Catrimani. The Mucajai group sought revenge for the witchcraft death, for the death of the brother-in-law, and for the insults. With the help of an Aica guide, the raiding party made its way to the Catrimani River. There they were well received by the Catrimani, who gave them welcoming gifts of meat and bananas. They thought the Mucajai group had come for a friendly visit. On the third day the shooting, stabbing, axing, and stoning began. In a short period of time, eight Catrimani men were killed. Four women aged 16, 17, 19, and 20 were seized as captives along with four of their children ranging in ages from one to seven."

In 1970 they helped the Marashiteri raid the Duhunteri to avenge sickness due to witchcraft. In 1978 they helped the Paramiteri raid the Parahudi for the same reason. In both cases, the Mucajai men had inmigrant wives from the raiding groups and they were fulfilling their obligations of reciprocity. No women captives were taken by the Mucajai in either of these raids."
124	"Early, John D. The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	744 758 797	During the first phase the missionaries initiated their medical program. They dispensed medicines. Three serious medical cases were sent to Boa Vista for treatment and one infant received an operation in Rio de Janeiro. Preventive measures were taken. In 1966 a Brazilian physician immunized the group against tuberculosis. Spraying to prevent malaria was initiated about the same time.
125	"Early, John D. The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	164 177 464 744 758	"The middle phase (1970-1979) had low mortality even though infectious disease still accounted for 42% of the deaths. Several reasons appear important for the low mortality of this phase. The Mucajai group probably acquired some natural immunity to these diseases so that their effect was not as lethal as in the previous phase. The clinical and preventive efforts of the medical program were probably having an impact. These efforts were increased during this phase and more cases were referred to Brazilian medical services in Boa Vista. The immunization efforts were expanded to include diphtheria-whooping cough-tetanus, measles, yellow fever, and tuberculosis. The immunization program was continuous and records were kept to ensure its effectiveness. Contact with the national society was still limited compared with the events of the third phase. A few Mucajai performed wage labor downstream at an isolated Brazilian ranch. The downstream trips continued with the Mucajai remaining away from the villages for longer periods than in phase 1. FUNAI hired two Mucajai men to work in the pacification of other Yanomama areas."
126	"Early, John D. The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	751 753 754 761	"The Yanomama do not have an elaborate system of disease classification. Usually symptoms are described and it is implied that the death resulted from these symptoms in some unspecified manner. However there is an emic category used to explain mortality which will become an important factor in the analysis of the overall population dynamics--witchcraft. When the high mortality from infectious disease began to occur, the Mucajai were extremely upset and wanted an explanation. The deaths were perceived to be the result of witchcraft by other Yanomama villages. When mortalities are interpreted in this way, there may be an ensuing raid of revenge on the bewitching village. This perception of witchcraft was responsible for all four raids in which the Mucajai group have been involved in the postcontact period as well as the in-migration resulting from them."
127	"Early, John D. The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	439 758 797	"The rest of the Mucajai Yanomama have remained indifferent to the religious activity of the missionaries or have explicitly rejected it and reaffirmed their commitment to the patterns rejected by the missionaries. Regardless of their reaction, all in the community have continued to frequent the mission for trade and medical purposes. The Yanomama see these as essential activities of the missionaries and they do not regard their rejection of the religious activity as rejection of the missionaries themselves. The missionaries, in turn, have offered their trade and medical services to all the community without distinction."

The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	166 439 583 696 758 797	"As noted in Table 6.1, the missionaries introduced the Mucajai group to four of the six groups from which they received postcontact in-migration. Of the 58 in-migrants, 42 (72.4%) were from these groups. Also, the missionaries, by supplying medical assistance and trade [Page 96] goods to the Mucajai people, contributed to their prestige in the region. This reputation was important in allowing Mucajai men to quickly return to their own village after a brief period of bride service. It was influential for the village to be seen as a place of refuge by families escaping revenge in their own villages. In-migration was a key factor in changing the age--sex distribution, and the missionaries were a key factor in initiating the in-migration. These demographic effects were never a matter of intentional policy by the missionaries."
129	"Early, John D. The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	165 177 439 721 758 797 847	"The missionaries have also lowered the level of mortality. There was less preferential female infanticide according to the testimony of the Yanomama. It is not known whether this was a significant decrease or not. The missionaries know of only two cases where their influence prevented female infanticides. Medical assistance has lowered morbidity and consequently mortality by an unknown amount. The mission has also lessened mortality by supplying trade goods. The Mucajai people had an insatiable desire for steel tools and, without the missionaries, [Page 97] would have made many more downstream trips to obtain them. This would have increased the frequency of their contacts with rural Brazilians and consequently with infectious disease and alcoholism. The missionaries also mitigated mortality by acting as a restraining force against raids and the accompanying homicides. When Mucajai men were killed by unknown Yanomama and presumably by Xiriana, their kin spoke openly of retaliatory raids. The missionaries helped to calm the situation so that these raids never materialized. Finally, the presence of the missionaries deterred raids by other Yanomama. None occurred. It is impossible to quantify how much the missionaries lowered the mortality of the Mucajai, but their presence was a significant factor in the low mortality of phase 2 and the moderate mortality of phase 3."
130	"Early, John D. The population dynamics of the Mucajai Yanomama"	160 162 178 582 595 606 753 754 837	"This completes the analysis of demographic structure and culture. The previous chapter has shown how fertility with a balanced sex ratio at birth and free or captive female in-migration for marriage changed the age-sex distribution of the Mucajai group, especially by reducing the imbalanced sex ratio of the reproductive population. This chapter has shown how a changed age-sex structure has, in turn, changed the intensity of two cultural patterns. There was an increase in monogamous marriages and a corresponding decrease in polyandrous marriages. Where wife-sharing was retained, there was a diminution of the number of males in the sharing networks. The change in the [Page [p.115]] Table 9.5 Schematic of Principal Demographic and Cultural Changes [Page 116] age--sex distribution also diminished the age difference between marital partners. This, in turn, increased the age differences between mothers-in-law and sons-in-law, thereby reducing potential sexual conflict within family groups. As a result the avoidance patterns between mothers-in-laws and sons-in-laws have diminished. Table 9.5 gives a synoptic view of these changes. In brief, the synthetic section has shown how culture affects the demographic structure of a population (Chapter 8), and how this, in turn, affects the intensity of some cultural patterns (Chapter 9)."
131	"Hames, Raymond B. Culture summary: Yanoama"	756 772 774 775 776 797	"The Yanoama believe that the cosmos consists of four parallel planes or layers. The upper-most layer is empty but was once occupied by ancient beings who descended to lower layers. The second layer, or sky, is the home of spirits of dead men and women and it resembles the earth except that the hunting is better, the food tastier, and the spirits of the people are young and beautiful. The third layer is the earth, and below the earth is the fourth layer, or the underworld. The AMAHI-TERI, ancient spirits who bring harm to humans, live in the underworld. The Yanoama have multiple souls that exist in a complex relation to one another. All shamans can use spirits (HEKIRA) over which they have personal control to cure or cause illnesses. Catholic and evangelical Protestant missionaries have been in steady contact with the Yanoama since the late 1950s but have had very little success in conversion."
132	"Hames, Raymond B. Culture summary: Yanoama"	703 754 756	"Shamans are called upon to divine the causes of illness or misfortune, cure the ill, and sicken the enemy by sending spirits or demons that the shaman controls. Shamans are also expert at using wild and domesticated plants that are useful for casting spells. Only men can be shamans and they must endure arduous training requiring food deprivation and abstinence from sex."
133	"Hames, Raymond B. Culture summary: Yanoama"	266 754 764 775	"The Yanoama attribute a large fraction of deaths to the actions of malevolent shamans who send demons or evil spirits to consume the souls of people. Upon death there are lamentations, singing, and chanting. Usually, the corpse is very quickly burned by the men while women and children absent themselves from the village lest they become polluted by the smoke. The men then collect and pulverize the bones and pour the ash into a set of gourds that are stored in the village. As noted above, after about a year the Yanoama stage an elaborate mortuary ceremony (REAHU). Close relatives, co-villagers, and sometimes allies consume the ash which is mixed into a large trough of plantain soup. This ritual demonstrates affection for the dead and solidarity with the deceased's relatives. It also helps insure that the soul of the dead will find its way to HEDU, a Yanoama paradise above the earth."
134	"Hames, Raymond B. Culture summary: Yanoama"	276 753 756 757	"The Yanoama believe that most serious illness is the handiwork of independently acting HEKIRA or enemy shamans who have caused their spirits or HEKIRA to sicken a body. A shaman must diagnose the cause and sometimes figuratively pull the spirit or demon out, often with the help of his own spirits. To prepare, a shaman frequently decorates himself and his surroundings handsomely and invariably inhales a hallucinogenic snuff to aid contact with the HEKIRA. Illness may also be caused by the breach of a ritual regulation or taboo. The Yanoama also employ a variety of herbal remedies as cures."
135	"Layrisse, Miguel. Blood group antigen tests of the Waica Indians of Venezuela"	105 582 591 595 601 622 624 756	"The local groups of the Yanoama are composed of bands of several extended families with nuclear family households. Residence rules have, as yet, not clearly been established, but judging from the Sanemá of the Erebato and from the [Page 82] Waica, 9 Berker, 1953, p. 478. there seems to be a strong tendency towards bilocality. Although bilocal extended families are relatively rare, 10 Murdock, 1949, p.35. their existence among the semi-nomadic Yanoama could very well be possible, since there do not exist any decisive economic factors which could strongly favor unilocal residence. Among the Sanemá of the Caura (incipient agriculturists) we have observed initial matrilocal with subsequent patrilocal residence and a rather formal initiation of common residence of the spouses. Polygyny is permitted and young girls are frequently married to men even before their first menstruation. The kinship system is of the Hawaiian type."
136	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	000 171 554 756 791 793	"As we shall see, Sanemá society seems to have three different theurgists: a “ magician ” / mago /, a shaman , and a priest . This last one possesses characteristics of a real specialist, since, for the most part, he earns his living from his office. There is not the least doubt but that the theurgists in general, and the shaman and priest in particular, represent the most influential position in Sanemá society; particularly if the two offices are carried out by one and the same person. We were greatly surprised to find [Page 84] 212 cont. this stratification among the Sanemá nomads, although it did not overwhelm us, since we were already aware of a similar situation among the Warao (Wilbert, 1957a)."
137	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	121 756 773 793	"We do not think that anybody would care to argue that the Yanoama represent a degenerate people, for, if we admit authentic Marginals, the Yanoama are part of them. They have, however, the concept of a deified Cultural Hero, the author of all and constantly concerned with his creation. He is the cause, the beginning, and the end of all men and makes use of a priest as an intermediary between the earth and the sky. This person-age is different from the shaman and his sphere."
138	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	753	"In the majority of cases, sickness has a magical cause and the theurgists attempt to cure those who are within their field of action. We did not penetrate into this intimate sphere of Sanemá culture and the little that we heard is set forth in the section which deals with religious and magical aspects of these Indians."
139	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	159 753 763 764 825	"He had gone out to the forest. There he had found an eagle. As eagles are men, they may only be killed if they are enemies of one's pueblo. The father asked the eagle whether he was a Waica or a Sanemá, and, when it answered that it was a Waica, the Sanemá man killed it with his arrow. Naturally he observed all the taboos that are obligatory for a hunter who kills an eagle. A few days later he became sick. He had a very high fever and remembered that when he picked up the eagle he got the impression that it was feverish, and, as birds of prey are often sent by a theurgist of neighboring enemies in order to kill the people, that explained everything. There was no reason to look for any other cause, the diagnosis was clear, the eagle had transmitted its sickness to the hunter. He became worse as the days went by and 220 finally died; but he had first explained to the members of his family the cause of his sickness and the reason for his certain death."
140	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	159 756 764 784	"Our informant spent several nights next to his father's corpse, always being very careful not to step on the damp ground beneath the dead man, because those who step there lose their feet."
141	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	756 765 775	"Later the sablí carries the bones to a fire prepared in the plaza and places them on top of the pile of firewood. Our informant also said that as the sablí did this he pronounced a well-known formula which means: \""you are getting along well,\"" for, if he did not say this, the híkula would not be able to find its way. Afterwards he lights the fire, blows upon it at the same time as he raises his arms 221 above his head, and in the smoke [Page 95] 221 cont. that rises the nonmaterial part of the man ascends, his híkula and his soul and possibly something else which we do not yet understand. On occasion the owner of the híkula can be heard as he comes whistling to carry the híkula of the dead man to the place where all the others are to be found."
142	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	276 756 765	"The men take great quantities of yopo and dance around the fire which relentlessly consumes the bones. They sing and dance all night long, while the relatives cry out against their neighboring enemies. The ceremony comes to an end in the morning, at which time the sablí pulls out the bones in order to pulverize them in a gourd."
143	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	756 791 793	"Yanoama society seems to have three theurgists or religious practitioners, but each one belongs to and officiates in a different supernatural sphere."
144	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	114 755 775 778 793	"The hikulad[unknown] of the priest, the informant explained, is like a globe which the h[unknown] wïawán keeps in his chest. We shall also see later that the other religious practitioner of the Sanema has a hikulad[unknown] too, but one which is essentially different. We have the impression that the hikulad[unknown] of the priest contains \""the souls\"" of the ancestors who were destined by Omao to live there and help the priest. Since the data obtained are, in our opinion, insufficient, we do not want to hazard peremptory statements, but it seems certain that the Sanemá priest also cures the sick, particularly those who are suffering from fever. Our informant explained to us that the ancestors ( hikula-dïb ), the people of the hikulad[unknown] of the priest, are the ones who cure the fever when the priest brings the hikulad[unknown] out of his chest and deposits it for a time on the body of the patient."
145	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	755 775 793 825	"The function of the scarab in the curing process is as follows: If the h[unknown] wïawán wishes to cure a patient, he takes the híkula from his chest and places it upon the patient. In order to effect the cure, the scarab opens an invisible hole in the chest of the patient, and the hikulad[unknown] of the priest enters through there. 225 Once within the patient's chest, the híkula-dïb come out of the hikulad[unknown] in order to combat and bring to the exterior the cause of the sickness. After a while the priest again takes possession of his hikulad[unknown] and the treatment is fully successful. The informant did not want to mention the name of the caleopteran or even to talk about it, fearing that if he were to do so and if he were then to become sick, the priest would not be able to cure him, since the insect would not open a hole in the chest of the patient."
146	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	755 775 793	"It is our impression that the priest only cures the ailments that result from the presence, in the body of the sick person, of the soul of a wandering deceased person who has approached the rancherias and whose very presence causes pain."
147	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	171 755 775 793	"If we understand that the part of the Sanemá which goes to the house of Omao is the soul, we may say that the priest is concerned with the well-being of the same in the bodies of his companions, and that he represents the actualizing principle between the subject “the soul of the man” and the object “Omao,” who enter into communication by means of the intervention of the priest. For the soul, which goes to live in the house of Omao as híkula-dïb , we noted down the name of h[unknown] npïrtïb , which essentially seems to correspond in its character to the “ bole ” of the Waica (Zerries, 1958b)."
148	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	000 754 775 793 825	"The h[unknown] wïawán may send a híkula-dïb to a neighboring pueblo in order to cause sickness among its inhabitants, but his primary function is to guarantee the well-being of the souls of his community and to present them eventually to Omao at death. It is interesting in this respect to note that the Surara and Pakidai, subgroups of the Yanoama of Brazil, are of the opinion that sicknesses are transmitted by a shaman of a neighboring pueblo by means of sparrow hawks and bats. The Sanemá say that the [Page 101] 225 cont. h[unknown]wïawán kills vultures and sparrow hawks on his travels (Becher, 1960, p. 96). As we have already explained in another section of this chapter, the Sanemá believe that the eagle and other birds of prey are “men” who can be killed only if they belong to an enemy tribe."
149	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	756	"The second religious practitioner of the Sanemá is a shaman, who is called sablí . The supernatural world over which he has power is different from the world of the priest, and therefore his function is different from that of the former."
150	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	533 756	"In order to become a shaman, the candidate must submit to a very rigorous training under the guidance of an old sablí who knows how to sing the “Great K[unknown][unknown] .”."
151	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	123 262 276 515 756	"226 cont. During the period of apprenticeship, which lasts several weeks, the candidate takes yopo continually through a tube or simply with the hand, eats very little and only the food prescribed; he does not bathe and almost does not speak. Among the Waica of the Upper Orinoco I saw a group of these candidates who gave me a depressing impression since they showed prolonged suffering as a result of the consumption of the drug. We were not able to speak with them, and we were not allowed to take blood samples from them as we did with the other members of the rancheria."
152	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	533 756 774	"It seems that all the men are potentially sablíes , but among them there are some who are very strong and others who are weak, and only the strongest ones are able to sing the “ k[unknown][unknown] ” well. This song is rendered by the sablí at the end of his period of instruction, when the candidates are prepared and ready to receive the híkulas , or “specific vital principles” of the species of flora and fauna, with the exception of fish. As soon as they hear the call of their master, they obey and go toward his locality, where they find the sablí candidate waiting for them to enter his [Page 102] 226 cont. chest. They enter, without loss of time, through the extremities of the body and through the head. They arrive in the order in which their names are sung by the master sablí , who in this way “builds a pueblo” of a microcosmos in the body of the man. The stronger the master, the greater will be the “pueblo,” and the greater this “pueblo” is, the better chance the sablí will have to augment his inner world and his power during his life."
153	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	756 774 778	"The hikulad[unknown] of the sablí is essentially different from that of the priest, in the sense that it is inhabited by the vital principle of vegetable and animal species and not by the souls of departed ancestors. The man also has a specific híkula , different from his soul and which, as is true of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, seems to be immortal and spiritual, essentially joined to animate matter until death. Each specimen of a species has a specific híkula ; after death, the speciman goes to a luminous place in the forest. While the soul of a man may abandon the body during sleep, etc., without its being detrimental for the man himself, the híkula never leaves until the moment of death. Furthermore, the soul is typically human, while the híkula is found in man and also in plants and animals. Some informed us with insistence that women and small children do not have híkula ."
154	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	756 773 774	"In those days there lived among the Sanemá a great sablí , very famous and extremely powerful, who began to think of how he could free them from this demon. The great sablí went off to the forest, and there he found a liana which seemed very suitable for his purposes. He cut a piece of the bejuco and returned. During the night he went to the house of Chinanídmawan in order to surprise him while he was asleep surrounded by his horrible trophies. In fact he did find him in a deep sleep; the sablí then introduced a piece of the liana up his anus. The demon woke up startled. He realized that a powerful sablí had found the means of killing him. In fact, shortly thereafter Chinanídmawan died, and the Sanemá exposed his corpse to the sun so that the flesh might rot. But because the demon had such tough skin, the flesh dried up and the skin remained intact; they then tried to burn it, but this was impossible, so they flung it into the forest and fled from the place."
155	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	533 756 778 825	"The Sanemá sablí has great power over animals and plants represented in his hikulad[unknown] , with which he communicates while he is asleep. If he should dream about a dangerous animal, a jaguar for instance, he makes him sit down in order to begin the song õkamõ against jaguars. This song keeps the jaguar from the rancheria, but, when it is relatively near, the hikulad[unknown] of the sablí goes out to kill the jaguar in the forest, where the hunters will find him dead on the following day. But if the men sent by the sablí do not find the body of the jaguar, everybody remains in the rancheria on the following day, for they fear that the Great Jaguar may be in the forest and will kill anybody found in his way."
156	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	533 754 756 774 825	"The sablíes sing almost every night, and the bigger the animal who appears to them in their dreams, the more intense is the song. In his songs, the sablí can send any híkula from his chest to go and kill a man in a foreign rancheria, however far it is. Usually he does this at night, and on the following day the victim's companions find him dead in his hammock."
157	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	753 754 756 761 774	"I have the impression that the híkulas belonging to the various species are, of themselves, absolutely passive and that they behave in an active way only at the command and wish of the sablí . Most sicknesses, including death, are caused by a híkula introduced into the body of the man by the intervention of the sablí and by his magical power."
158	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	755 756 774	"The priest sablí , influenced by the effects of yopo , shouts, sings, and dances around the patient. With this he attempts to scare off the harmful híkula which is striving to enter the body of the man. It is very often personified by a man who is symbolically fought by the híkula of the sablí and others chosen from his “pueblo of híkula ” in his chest. The curative art of the sablí depends to a great degree on his diagnosis, according to which he chooses from his great híkula in his chest those which, by their skill, can combat the híkula or híkulas causing the sickness. It goes without saying that a young and inexperienced sablí makes mistakes in his diagnosis of identifying, from among all the possible thousands, the híkula which is causing the sickness sent by an enemy. It [Page 105] 228 cont. may also happen that a sablí with a small “pueblo” of híkulas in his chest does not have at his disposal a híkula suitable for bringing about the desired result. In this case, one turns to a more expert sablí , who will receive for his services presents of food, etc. A young sablí is always hopeful that the híkula “pueblo” in his chest will grow. But the 229 older the man becomes, the less opportunity he has of augmenting his power."
159	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	624 756 774 789	"The potentiality of the híkula of the sablí makes him invulnerable, and should anyone shoot an arrow at him he breaks his hand and his weapons. For this reason the sablí is the best man to lead as the war chief, or at least he inspires and helps with his magical power and his singing along the way."
160	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	754 756 763 774	"A sablí of great power does not die until all the híkulas of the plants, animals, and, some say, of the stars have come to live in his chest, and, when they have done this, the power of his híkula grows and brings about his death. Then the sablí informs his people, says farewell to all those whom he has protected during all the years of his adult life, and, as a last service, promises to kill the neighboring enemy group just as soon as his híkula frees itself from his body. On dying, the red stone which he had, which had come down with a great noise from heaven, once again goes back up to the place from which it came 24 I have not been able to gather any further details regarding this stone, nor have I seen it. ."
161	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	171 754 755 791	"A third type of theurgist which seems to exist in Sanemá society is the magician, the káilala . He does not sing like the sablí and has no influence over the specific híkulas or over souls. He is the curer of the organism, of the body of a man. He cures by uttering tremendous cries, gives massages on the ailing and painful limbs of his patients. Suddenly he will surprise all those [Page 107] 230 cont. present by taking out from under his tongue stones, small sticks, vermin, etc. “Arrows” come out in the form of a black liquid, of tobacco, etc. He spits out and tramples on what he has been able to extract. The káilala of the Sanemá also possesses power that is benevolent and malignant at the same time and can shoot magic arrows at the enemy rancheria, thus causing sickness or death. If we compare this religious complex of the Sanemá with that of the Warao, we find such a great similarity that there cannot be the least doubt but that both have the same origin."
162	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	753 755 771 776 778 793	"The Warao temple cult is furthermore completely separate from shamanism and magic ; religious matters are the responsibility of especially designated persons who act only within their own domain. 231 The fact that the priest may cure sickness must not lead the observer to false conclusions, since it is logical, according to Warao mentality, that the priest controls -- through the power of God -- the spirits of heaven, whose desire is to take everyone to the side of God, to whom they owe obedience and whose orders are transmitted to them by the mediation of the priest. These are spirits objectively good, but which become subjectively bad when with their metaphysical capability they enter the body of a man, physically limited, causing a pressure, that is, a sickness. In Warao terminology the priest cures by “alleviating this pressure,” bringing about as a result typical ailments, such as fevers of various kinds, which he cures by frightening away the spirits with merely his presence, but in particularly critical and difficult cases he may also use one of his maraca /gourd rattle/."
163	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	754 755 756 776 778 791 793	"This latter instrument in the hands of the priest-doctor might cause one to err by identifying him with the shaman, although actually the maraca of a priest and that of a shaman are considered by the Warao as essentially different. The powers of the maraca of the priest are guaranteed by the kareko stones which are inside it, a second category of spirits which belong to the court of God. The stones in the maraca of the shaman represent other powers. So, although morphologically both instruments have the same origin, functionally they have become specialized, probably in different fashion, by our Indians. Warao shamanism is based on the conception of the existence of an immanent essence in all objects which can only be freed by the power of the shaman for the purpose of being directed toward someone's body. Each shaman has also the power to extract this type of essence from a person, that is, to cure him of his sickness. The shaman cures by smoking, emitting smoke and blowing, and, when he does so, he must rest his hand on the affected part, while he allows to pass through his mind numerous images of objects, until he fixes his attention on a special one which is the object which caused the sickness, as a result of which the spirit immediately jumps to his hand or to the maraca . The magician, finally, takes out from the body of a person or puts into it material objects, the causes of sickness."
164	"Wilbert, Johannes. The Sanema"	532 539 751 821	"The moon went to the other side of the world, and, while the sun sealed its friendship with man, the moon was his irreconcilable enemy. When the moon appears rose-colored, it is because it, along with its family, is eating men. The sun also has a family, but does not eat human flesh. Sometimes the moon hides in its house in order to plan a new campaign. During that time women are very much afraid and, in order to protect themselves, paint a likeness of the sun on their cheeks; they also commonly paint it on large stones which they find on the path."
